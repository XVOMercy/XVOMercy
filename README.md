**Hi, I'm Mercy. I'm just a developer.**

I code in a lot of languages, but most of the content you will find on my GitHub ranges from Minecraft projects, game projects, and other personal projects I'm working on.

A bit more personal about me, I usually use this GitHub for personal projects, but I mainly work in Cybersecurity.

You can call me Rolan or Mercy, I don't care.

If you have any questions, my main contact is on Discord at Mercy#4567 or Rolan#4567.
