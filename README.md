**Hi, I'm Mercy. I'm just a developer.**

I code in a lot of languages, but most of the content you will find on my GitHub ranges from Minecraft projects, game projects, and other personal projects I'm working on.

A bit more personal about me, I usually use this GitHub for personal projects, but I mainly work in Cybersecurity.
